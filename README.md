## ExtJS 4.0.7 snippets for Sublime Text ##  
### Snippets for Sublime Text that will help you autocomplete most of the xtypes and listeners in ExtJS 4.0.7. ###

The snippets that create xtypes will select itself as the last field tab selection for copy/pasting ease.

Note that I have selected what seemed to make sense in a balance act in showing API info vs. too many options to tab through.  
This will need some tweaking as the snippets are being used/refined
